# Normalizing Flow

This Repository contains my footprints of struggle on Normalizing Flow models. I try to understand and applying normalizing flow(NF). 

Curriculum is based on [This repository](https://github.com/janosh/awesome-normalizing-flows#-table-of-contents)("awesome-normalizing-flows by janosh").

    > Normalizing flows in the form of Gaussianization in an iterative format. Also shows connections to information theory.
